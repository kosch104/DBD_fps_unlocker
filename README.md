# Dead by Daylight FPS Unlocker

This is a small tool to help bypass the default 60 FPS Limit in Dead By Daylight.


## How to use

Click on [Releases](https://github.com/kosch104/DBD_fps_unlocker/releases) and download the latest version. It's a single file, just save it anywhere you want.

Execute the file - the preset path should work fine for most people. Just enter the number of FPS you want your limit to be and press the button. Done!

### Is this... legal?

- [x] Yes
- [x] Of Course
- [x] All of the Above


The tool works by editing a configuration file from the game to disable VSync and set your wanted frame limit. This is not bannable or prohibited in any way, all changes can be made with a simple text editor.

### Why don't just edit the text file if it's that easy?

I'm a lazy person and some updates reset my config file. So I wrote this tool to do all the work in one click.
