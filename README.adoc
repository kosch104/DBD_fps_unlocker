= Dead by Daylight FPS Unlocker

This is a small tool to help bypass the default 60 FPS Limit in Dead By Daylight.


=== Is this... legal?

* [x] Yes
* [x] Of Course
* [x] All of the Above


The tool works by editing a configuration file from the game to disable VSync and set your wanted frame limit. This is not bannable or prohibited in any way, all changes can be made with a simple text editor.

=== Why don't just edit the text file if it's that easy?

I'm a lazy person and some updates reset my config file. So I wrote this tool to do all the work in one click.
